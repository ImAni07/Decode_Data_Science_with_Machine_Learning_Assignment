    "a. The first question asks about the Length of the given Tuple.\n",

    "b. The second question asks to access the last element of a tuple, and then access a dictionary within that element to retrieve the value associated with the key \"name\".\n",

    "    The breakdown of the above statement is given as follows:\n",
    "        i. tuple1[-1]: This accesses the last element of the tuple tuple1.\n",
    "        ii. tuple1[-1][-1]: This accesses the last element of the inner tuple/list.\n",

    "c. The third question asks to fetch the value of 'roll_no' from the given Tuple.\n",

    "        i. tuple1[7] gives the list [{\"roll_no\": 1}, {\"name\": \"Navneet\"}].\n",
    "        ii. tuple1[7][0] gives the dictionary {\"roll_no\": 1}.\n",
    "        iii. tuple1[7][0][\"roll_no\"] gives the value 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Hence, the Output is 1 and the Index of the value 'roll_no' can be referred as tuple1 [7][0].\n",
    "\n",
    "d. The fourth question asks to fetch the Third Last Element of the Tuple and print its Second Element. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The process can be broken down as follows:\n",
    "        i. The tuple 'tuple1' contains several elements, including a list at index -3 (i.e., the third element from the end). This list is [\"master\", \"ji\"].\n",
    "        ii. When 'tuple1 [-3][1]' is accessed, firstly, the element at index -3 of 'tuple1' is fetched, which is the list [\"master\", \"ji\"] and secondly, the element at index 1 of this list is fetched, which is \"ji\".\n",

    "    i. Initialization: An empty list 'prime_num_list' is created to store the prime numbers found.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    iii. Checking for Primality:\n",
    "        a. For each number 'n' in the range, a flag 'is_prime' is set to \"True\", assuming it's prime initially.\n",
    "        b. The code then checks if 'n' is divisible by any number 'i' between 2 and the square root of 'n' (inclusive) using another for loop. For finding the square root of 'n', math module has been used.\n",
    "        c. If 'n' is divisible by any 'i' (i.e., 'n % i == 0'), the 'is_prime' flag is set to \"False\" and the inner loop is exited using the 'break' statement.\n",
    "        d. If the 'is_prime' flag remains \"True\" after the inner loop, it means 'n' is a prime number, and it's appended to the \"prime_num_list\".\n",
    "        e. The code repeats this process for all numbers between 2 and 100, and the resulting list of prime numbers is printed at the end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    iv. Output:\n",
    "        a. Finally, the code prints the list of prime numbers found, along with the count of prime numbers in the specified range.\n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Objective: This program is designed to take user input for marks in 5 subjects, calculate the total marks and percentage, and then determine the grade based on the percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Functions used in the Program:\n",
    "    a. 'accept_subjects()' function: This function takes user input for the names of 5 subjects and returns a list of these subjects. It uses a for loop to iterate 5 times, asking the user to enter the name of each subject.\n",
    "    b. 'accept_marks(subjects)' function: This function takes user input for the marks of each subject and returns a dictionary where the keys are the subject names and the values are the corresponding marks. It uses a for loop to iterate over the list of subjects, asking the user to enter the marks for each subject.\n",
    "    c. 'calculate_total_marks(marks)' function: This function calculates the total marks by summing up all the values in the marks dictionary.\n",
    "    d. 'calculate_percentage(total_marks)' function: This function calculates the percentage by dividing the total marks by 5.\n",
    "    e. 'determine_grade(percentage)' function: This function determines the grade based on the percentage. The grades are:\n",
    "        A: above 85%\n",
    "        B: 75% to 85%\n",
    "        C: 50% to 75%\n",
    "        D: above 30% to 50%\n",
    "        Reappear: below 30%\n",
    "    f. 'main()' function: This is the main function that runs the program. It calls the above functions in sequence, prints the results, and finally determines the grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Steps of the Program:\n",
    "    a. The program asks the user to enter the names of 5 subjects.\n",
    "    b. It then asks the user to enter the marks for each subject.\n",
    "    c. The total marks are calculated by summing up all the marks.\n",
    "    d. The percentage is calculated by dividing the total marks by 5.\n",
    "    e. The grade is determined based on the percentage.\n",
    "    f. The program prints the subjects, marks, total marks, percentage, and grade.\n",
    "    g. The program uses Python's built-in input() function to get user input, and the print() function to display the results. It also uses a dictionary to store the subjects and marks, and the sum() function to calculate the total marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Output: Sample Output (for this code) -\n",

    "i. Objective:\n",
    "    a. This code calculates the gravitational forces between the Earth and the Sun, and the Moon and the Earth, and then compares these forces to determine which is stronger.\n",
    "    b. It also explains which celestial body is more attracted to the other based on the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Initialization:\n",
    "    a. First, the 'math' module is imported (the only necessary module)\n",
    "    b. The given and constant values are defined. The given values are the masses of the Earth, Moon, and Sun, as well as the average distances between the Earth and Sun, and the Moon and Earth. The constant value is the gravitational constant, G.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Calculation: The gravitational forces between the Earth and the Sun, and the Moon and the Earth, are calculated, using the formula:\n",
    "                    \"F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2\"\n",

    "                        r is the distance between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Printing: The calculated forces are then printed, and the code compares the two forces to determine which is stronger. If the force between the Earth and the Sun is greater, the code prints that the Earth is more attracted to the Sun than the Moon is to the Earth. If the force between the Moon and the Earth is greater, the code prints that the Moon is more attracted to the Earth than the Earth is to the Sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Outcome:\n",
    "    a. The gravitational force between Earth and Sun should be significantly stronger than the gravitational force between Moon and Earth due to the massive difference in mass between the Sun and the Moon, despite the larger distance between the Earth and Sun. This means that the Earth is more attracted to the Sun based on gravitational force strength.\n",
